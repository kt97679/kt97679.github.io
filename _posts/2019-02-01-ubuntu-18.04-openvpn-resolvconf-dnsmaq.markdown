By default ubuntu 18.04 is using systemd-resolve. In order to use openvpn, resolvconf and dnsmasq you need to do following:

Ensure that all necessary packages are installed:

{% highlight bash %}
apt-get install -y openvpn resolvconf dnsmasq
{% endhighlight %}

NetworkManager will not control dnsmasq so we need to add following config:

{% highlight bash %}
echo -e "[main]\ndns=none" > /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dnsmasq.conf
{% endhighlight %}

Disable and stop systemd-resolved:

{% highlight bash %}
systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
systemctl stop systemd-resolved.service
{% endhighlight %}

Enable and start dnsmasq:

{% highlight bash %}
systemctl enable dnsmasq.service
systemctl start dnsmasq.service
{% endhighlight %}

Network settings including nameservers to use are managed by the NetworkManager. In order for NetworkManager to notify
resolvconf that settings need to be updated /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/resolvconf should be added:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

case "$2" in
  up)
    [ -z "$IP4_NAMESERVERS" ] && exit 0
    for x in $IP4_NAMESERVERS; do
        echo "nameserver $x" | /sbin/resolvconf -a "$1.networkmanager"
    done
    ;;
  down)
        /sbin/resolvconf -d "$1.networkmanager"
    ;;
  *) exit 0 ;;
esac
{% endhighlight %}

Modify /etc/resolvconf/update.d/dnsmasq (please note "openvpn support" comments):

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/sh
#
# Script to update the resolver list for dnsmasq
#
# N.B. Resolvconf may run us even if dnsmasq is not (yet) running.
# If dnsmasq is installed then we go ahead and update the resolver list
# in case dnsmasq is started later.
#
# Assumption: On entry, PWD contains the resolv.conf-type files.
#
# This file is part of the dnsmasq package.
#

set -e

RUN_DIR="/run/dnsmasq"
RSLVRLIST_FILE="${RUN_DIR}/resolv.conf"
TMP_FILE="${RSLVRLIST_FILE}_new.$$"
MY_NAME_FOR_RESOLVCONF="dnsmasq"

# Dnsmasq uses the mtime of $RSLVRLIST_FILE, with a resolution of one second,
# to detect changes in the file. This means that if a resolvconf update occurs
# within one second of the previous one then dnsmasq may fail to notice the
# more recent change. To work around this problem we sleep one second here
# if necessary in order to ensure that the new mtime is different.

Enable resolvconf:

{% highlight bash %}
resolvconf -u
{% endhighlight %}

Restart NetworkManager:

{% highlight bash %}
